<p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong>Participation</strong></p>

<h3>Students will actively engage and participate in the online Blackboard course environment. Active participation consists of the following actions and activities:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Purchase the required textbook by the end of first week of class.</li>
	<li>Engage actively in the course by reading, reviewing and watching pertinent instructional materials provided in the Blackboard course environment throughout the semester.</li>
	<li>Read all assignments, discussion forums and project guidelines thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Submit all assignments <strong><u>electronically </u></strong>by the due dates and times as specified in the guidelines provided.</li>
	<li>Participate in discussion forums by creating threads and posting comments by the due dates and times as specified in the guidelines provided.</li>
	<li>Contribute in a meaningful way to collaborative assignments and complete peer review surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><strong>***Peer</strong> <strong>Review Survey***</strong> Each student will be expected to complete a short peer review survey to help the instructor understand how each student worked together to complete the assignment and contribute to the success of the team. Please be aware that if the survey results reveal that a team member did not contribute adequately to the team, <strong>there will be a reduction in the points awarded resulting in a lower or failing grade on the team activity for that specific team member(s).</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Complete all assignments and projects by the due date and time specified.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Optional</strong> <strong>Extra</strong> <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>assignments: </strong>You will have opportunities to complete optional extra credit assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will have assigned due dates and times. You will not receive any points for these assignments if you do not complete these assignments by the specified due dates and times.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong>Course</strong> <strong>Activities</strong> <strong>Schedule</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">This online course follows a 14-week schedule with weekly assignments. Graded activities/tasks are due each week (assignments, discussion forums and projects). All graded activities/tasks for any given week are due on <strong>Friday by 11:30 pm EST</strong>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Missing Coursework</h2>

<h3>Any missed coursework will receive a grade of zero if an appropriate documented excuse is not provided. This includes all graded activities and tasks.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6.0pt"><strong>Documentation</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>illness</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:6.0pt">Students <u>MUST</u> notify the instructor in case of a non-life threatening emergency as soon as possible. It is your professional obligation to notify the instructor of any such emergency within a reasonable time period. A doctor&#39;s written verification of illness <u>MUST </u>be provided to the instructor before any make-up work will be accepted and/or rescheduled. For a non-medical emergency, securing documentation to support your explanation will increase the likelihood of being allowed the opportunity for make-up work. A doctor&#39;s note or other documentation will be accepted at the discretion of the instructor. If make-up work is granted, the instructor may alter the contents of such assignments or tests to minimize potential issues of academic integrity. The time lines for submitting make-up work will be determined by the instructor on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h4>Netiquette</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:6.0pt">An online course requires the same level of professionalism, respect, and courtesy that you would show your instructor and classmates in a face-to-face setting. To that end, please observe the following standards in the online class:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
	<li><strong>Discussion forums: </strong>The purpose of discussion forums in an academic setting is to advance the understanding of a given topic. Therefore, your threads and posts should:

	<ul>
		<li>be substantive (more than a few words), constructive, and on-topic;</li>
		<li>advance the discussion in a meaningful way;</li>
		<li>demonstrate professional courtesy;</li>
		<li>use correct grammar and punctuation (no acronyms commonly used in texting).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
	<li><strong>Electronic communication: </strong>You should avoid casual language and abbreviations commonly used in texting, which are not appropriate for in-class communication. Care should be taken to use correct grammar and punctuation.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
	<li><strong>Websites: </strong>You should use care when sharing websites in your posts by ensuring that the website is appropriate for an academic setting, non-offensive in nature, and relevant to the topic at hand.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h1>Instructor presence in your Course</h1>

<h2><br />
Instructor&rsquo;s Obligations to Students</h2>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">Just as I have expectations for your conduct and behavior in the course, you have expectations from me as your instructor. I will ensure that I maintain an active role in the course. I will log into the course daily and I will respond to any queries/concerns posted in the student lounge. I will ensure that I participate in all discussion forums periodically but please be aware that I will not respond to all discussion threads. I will also provide timely feedback to you on submitted assignments and projects. You are also encouraged to communicate privately with the instructor using the Send Email tool in Blackboard Learn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">You should expect a response from me within 24 hours of receiving your e-mails and course messages. I will be logging in and checking the course on a daily basis. Please note that I will typically be more available to address queries and respond to discussion forum comments in the evenings after 8:00 pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Resolving Technical Difficulties</h2>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">There are several things you can do to make your use of Blackboard easier:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Login: </strong>Test your username and password before your course is scheduled to begin. You can do this by clicking on the link: <a href="http://gannon.blackboard.com/">http://gannon.blackboard.com </a>and enter your login information (Gannon username and password). If you are unable to log into Blackboard contact ITS at 814- 871-7501 for assistance.</li>
	<li><strong>Getting Help: </strong>There are a number of ways for you to learn how to use Blackboard Learn. Click on the links to below:

	<li><strong>Experiencing problems with Blackboard</strong>: If you encounter problems using Blackboard during the semester, you are responsible for communicating that problem to your instructor. You are also encouraged to contact the ITS Helpdesk to resolve technical difficulties by clicking on the ITS helpdesk button linked located in the course or on my.gannon.edu.</li>
